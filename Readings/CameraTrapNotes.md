# A Camera Trap for the Invisible - Notes
- **Advanced Detection Technology:** Researchers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are using detectors akin to giant 3D digital cameras to capture particle collision data. These detectors aim to identify "disappearing tracks" of particles that decay into dark matter, leaving subtle traces in the detector's layers.

- **AI-Driven "Track Trigger" Algorithm:** Ashutosh Kotwal and his team have developed a cutting-edge algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence to rapidly analyze 40 million particle collision snapshots per second, isolating rare patterns indicative of dark matter from an overwhelming volume of data.

- **High-Speed Silicon Chip Processing:** The "track trigger" algorithm is integrated into silicon chips, where parallel AI engines analyze each collision image in under 250 nanoseconds, filtering out unimportant data in real time.

- **Scalable System for Future Experiments:** Kotwal's team plans to build a prototype device by next summer, scaling up to a full system of approximately 2000 chips within 3â€“4 years. This system will ensure LHC detectors can efficiently process increasing data volumes as accelerator performance improves, enhancing the search for dark matter.
